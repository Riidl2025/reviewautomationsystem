PROJECT CONTEXT FILE
Startup Screening & Meeting Automation System

Author: Chaitanya Sathe
Purpose: Internship Project

---

1. PROJECT GOAL

Automate startup application screening and scheduling.

Full workflow:

Startup submits application →
System evaluates PPT →
Decision generated →
Email sent →
Founder books slot →
Meeting created automatically in Google Calendar with Meet link.

---

2. CURRENT ARCHITECTURE

INPUT SOURCE (Current Testing)

* Google Form + Apps Script
* Data stored in Supabase (form_responses table)

Future Plan:

* Replace with AWS DynamoDB as primary source.

---

3. WORKER PIPELINE

ppt_worker.py:

Steps:

1. Fetch unscreened rows
2. Download PPT
3. Convert PPT → PDF
4. Extract text
5. Send to OpenAI scorer
6. Compute total score + decision
7. Store result in screening_results
8. Send email with booking link
9. Mark screened=yes

Error handling:

* Failed rows marked as "failed"
* Processing continues to next row

---

4. EMAIL AUTOMATION

Emails include:

* Decision result
* Booking link
* Personalized company name

Issue found earlier:

* Incorrect booking links due to wrong BOOKING_LINK_BASE
* Fixed by ensuring base URL only, not full query string

---

5. BOOKING SYSTEM

Flask booking_server.py:

Features:

* Fetch available slots
* Display UI
* Save booking
* Lock slot
* Create calendar event
* Send invites

Important logic:

* Double booking prevention
* Slot locking in database

---

6. GOOGLE CALENDAR INTEGRATION

calendar_helper.py:

Creates:

* Event
* Meet link
* Attendees list

Requirements:

* Founder must receive invite
* Team emails must receive invite
* Correct company name must appear in event title

Security improvement planned:

* Move attendee emails to environment variables

---

7. DATABASE TABLES

form_responses

* id
* companyname
* email
* ppt
* screened

screening_results

* startup_id
* scores_json
* decision
* reasoning
* email_sent

meeting_slots

* slot_time
* is_booked

meeting_bookings

* companyname
* email
* slot_time

---

8. MAJOR ISSUES ENCOUNTERED

Apps Script:

* Occasional trigger failures
* Column mismatch errors
* Risk of losing submissions

Booking System:

* UI rendering issues when slots empty
* Wrong booking links generated
* Startup_id missing in some flows

Calendar:

* Company name sometimes incorrect
* Founder not receiving invite in early tests

Environment:

* Secrets initially hardcoded
* Migrated to .env

---

9. RELIABILITY CONCERNS IDENTIFIED

Risk points:

* Apps Script trigger failures
* Database write failures
* Email sending failures
* Calendar API failures

Plan:

* Add retry logic
* Improve logging
* Move toward AWS pipeline

---

10. NEXT DEVELOPMENT PHASE

Planned improvements:

1. Redesign ingestion pipeline
2. Integrate AWS DynamoDB
3. Improve scoring JSON stability
4. Harden booking flow
5. Central config file
6. Better logging & monitoring
