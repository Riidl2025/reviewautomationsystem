## Metric 2.3: Customer Clarity & Targeting (4 points)

**What We're Measuring**: How well-defined and understood the target customer is

**Why It Matters**: "Everyone" is not a customer. Specificity enables focused sales, marketing, and product development.

**Scoring Criteria**:

- Pain points articulated in customer's own words
- Day-in-the-life understanding

Validation:
- 20+ customer interviews conducted
- Can quote specific customers verbatim
- Knows where customers congregate (conferences, forums, etc.)
- Has direct access to customer community

Example: "Target: HR Directors at mid-market SaaS companies (100-500 employees) in US.
- Buying process: HR Director identifies need → IT Security review (2 weeks) → CFO 
  approval for $50-100K → 60-90 day sales cycle
- Pain: 'We lose 10 hours/week on manual onboarding across 3 systems'
- Budget: $200-500 per employee annually for onboarding tools
- Where they are: SHRM conferences, HR Tech Slack communities, LinkedIn HR groups
- Interviewed 23 HR Directors, 15 said they'd pilot"
```

#### 3 Points - Clear Direction

```

#### 2 Points - Vague Targeting
```
Customer Definition:

✓ Economic catalyst (funding available, market conditions)

Evidence:
- Specific recent changes named (within 12-18 months)
- Competitor emergence validates timing
- Customer quotes: "We've been waiting for this"
- Recent news/events create urgency

## Usage Guidelines

### For Evaluators

1. **Read the entire pitch first** before scoring
2. **Score each sub-category independently** using rubrics
3. **Document specific evidence** for each score
4. **Apply red flags systematically** - don't miss critical issues
5. **Calculate total objectively** - let math determine decision
6. **Write reasoning** that explains the score
7. **Provide actionable feedback** even in rejections

### Consistency Checks

After scoring, verify:
- [ ] Total matches sum of categories +/- adjustments
- [ ] Scores supported by specific evidence from pitch
- [ ] Red flags applied consistently
- [ ] Decision matches score band
- [ ] Feedback is specific and actionable

### Common Evaluator Biases to Avoid

**Halo Effect**: Great team → assume everything else is great
- Fix: Score each category independently

**Recency Bias**: Remember last few startups evaluated
- Fix: Use rubric consistently, don't compare to recent applications

**Confirmation Bias**: Like the idea → find evidence to support
- Fix: Actively look for contradicting evidence

**Industry Bias**: Prefer familiar industries
- Fix: Use market size and traction objectively
